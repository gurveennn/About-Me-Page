<p class="bio">I work as a part time tutor for Mathnasium and help children from grades 2-11 to develop a strong foundation in mathamatics. Currently I am majoring in Computer Science and I'm in my second year at Simon Fraser University. I love to read books, go hiking and spend time with my cat Obi.</p>
