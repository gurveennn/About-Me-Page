Given my extensive background working in the retail industry, I have strengthened my communication and leadership skills. In addition to that, I have gained important non-technical skills
such as customer service and customer retention skills. Also being able to communicate in a professional manner and taking on more responsibility,

I am a very creative person and enjoy collaborating with others. I am also able to understand Hindi 
and Punjabi efficiently.
